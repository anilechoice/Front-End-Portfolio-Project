# Front End Portfolio Project
In this project, I decided to create a website called "The Business In One Place". This website allows the user to find news articles through searching by news outlet, article author, or article title. I used the news API, which has an array of objects of about 70 different news articles. 

For this, I worked from the front-end to the back-end. First, I completed my html files. I decided to do a sign in page, a registration page, and a page that will process the search, the display the article on the opposite side of the page. Although the log in and registration pages do not have an javascript, they are both linked to the search page through the submit buttons.

After I completed the HTMLs, I moved to the CSS files. The log in and registration pages share a CSS file and I completed a seperate one for the search page. I decided to go with a clean, neutral aesthetic for the page, being that it's for business articles. In addtion, I used Google fonts to find the two fonts on the three pages. I kept it extremely simple as most business webpages are and I wanted this project to be a genuine reflection of that is out there.

Lastly, I worked through the Javascript. I decided to do a search with the API.
